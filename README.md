# Data Analysis & Algorithmic Processing Pipeline (Showcase Version)

**Disclaimer: Partial Showcase**
This repository contains a sanitized, non-proprietary version of a larger data engineering and data science project. Certain components, including core logic and proprietary methodologies, have been intentionally omitted to protect intellectual property.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a Python-based system built for large-scale data retrieval, transformation, analysis, and automated reporting.
The project focuses on end-to-end pipeline design—collecting high-frequency time-series data, applying algorithmic evaluations, generating visual insights, and delivering real-time summaries through automated notification channels.

The full system was originally developed to handle streaming datasets, perform brute-force analytical experiments, and support rapid iteration on modeling ideas. This showcase highlights the structure, tooling, and engineering practices used throughout the project.

## Key Features

**Data Retrieval:**

* Automated ingestion of live and historical time-series data from external APIs.
* Robust error-handling and asynchronous request patterns.

**Analytics Engine:**

* Brute-force experimentation framework for generating metrics, evaluating parameter sweeps, and producing charts.
* Modular analysis structure enabling fast iteration on new algorithms or models.

**Automation & Reporting:**

* Real-time delivery of insights and visualizations through Telegram notifications.
* Fully automated scheduled pipelines for continuous operation and monitoring.

**Deployment:**

* Hosted on a VPS for 24/7 availability and reproducible execution environments.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Infrastructure:** VPS
* **APIs:** External REST API integrations
* **Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, AsyncIO, Requests, etc.
